Announcing:  CP/M Kermit Version 4.11

Just to prove that the CP/M world still exists, here is CP/M Kermit -80 
Version 4.11.

Features added since version 4.09 include:

o	SET COLLISION {BACKUP/DISCARD/OVERWRITE/RENAME}
o	SET INCOMPLETE-FILES {DISCARD/KEEP}
O	Many REMOTE commands, including some REMOTE SET commands
o	RENAME command to rename CP/M files from within Kermit-80
o	SET RECEIVE/SEND PACKET-LENGTH nn (nn <= 94)
o	SET AUTORECEIVE ON now implies that Kermit-80 ALWAYS tries to
	receive more files when a RECEIVE transaction has completed.  The
	user can abort with ^C.
o	QUIT is now a synonym for EXIT.
o	STAY is now a synonym for SET NO-EXIT.
o	CONNECT, RECEIVE and SEND may be abbreviated to C, R and S,
	respectively.
o	Processing of commands from a file via a TAKE command may now be
	aborted by entering a Control-C at the console.
o	The TYPE and PRINT commands are now immediately aborted if a
	Control-C is entered at the console. If a Control-X is entered at
	the console, typeout/printout of the current file is aborted and
	typeout/printout of the next file, if any, begins. These actions
	also occur if any other key has been pressed to halt typeout/printout
	and Control-C or Control-X is pressed. Pressing any other key resumes
	the typeout/printout.
o	Many bug fixes
o	Kermit-80 Version 4.11 now supports the Microbee family of
		computers (56K, 64K, 128K and 256K) manufactured by
		Microbee Systems, Ltd, of Australia.
o	Kermit-80 now supports the Ampro Little Board system.

Technical changes:

o	An "I" packet is now tried before the request for files is sent
		in a GET command
o	The overlay address is now 7000H
o	The overlay (CPXLNK.ASM) has an added INCFLG variable to handle
		INCOMPLETE-FILES status
o	The COPY, TYPE and PRINT commands now use the large buffer
		(8K bytes default size) for file I/O

Syntax hints:

In REMOTE commands such as REMOTE COPY, REMOTE MESSAGE, REMOTE RENAME,
REMOTE WHO etc., where two arguments are required, the syntax is as for Vax
VMS Kermit, i.e.,
REMOTE <command> <argument 1>
Prompt:  <argument 2>
For example:
REMOTE COPY <old-file>
New file: <new-file>

The REMOTE LOGIN command has three arguments, of which the last two are
prompted for an entered on new lines.  Arguments are optional.

In commands such as REMOTE SET FILE BLOCK-SIZE which take a numeric
argument, Kermit-80 does not check the argument for validity.  Whatever is
typed is what the host sees.

The FCOPY command has been renamed to COPY.

The syntax for the RENAME command is as for the COPY command, that is:
RENAME <old-filespec> <new-filespec>

More rigorous checking for wildcards is now done by both of these
commands.

The STRING command has been renamed to OUTPUT.

SET BAUD-RATE is now SET SPEED.

The option SET FILE DEFAULT has ben re-enabled.  Use a TAKE-file to set the
initial file-mode to ASCII or BINARY.

Building Kermit-80 ver. 4.11:

Kermit-80 ver. 4.11 is built using the same procedure as for ver. 4.09.


Many thanks to those who have contributed bug fixes, and, in particular,
to Mr. Russell Lang of Monash University, Australia, for contributing
a bug-fix and the family file for the Microbee systems and to Mr.
Jay S. Rouman of Mt. Pleasant, MI for contributing the code for the Ampro
Little Board. Thanks are also due to Lance Tagliapietra of the University
of Wisconsin at Platteville for finding several bugs.
